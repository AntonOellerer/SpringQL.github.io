# Syntax

SQL supported in SpringQL is syntactically defined in PEG (parsing expression grammars).

You can refer to full syntax currently supported in [this file](https://github.com/SpringQL/SpringQL/blob/main/springql-core/src/sql_processor/sql_parser/pest_grammar/springql.pest).

Note, however, that some syntactically valid statements would not work properly from implementations issue.
